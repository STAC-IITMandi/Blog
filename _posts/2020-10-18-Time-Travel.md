> EVEN IF WE IT TURNS OUT THAT TIME TRAVEL IS IMPOSSIBLE, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE   -Stephen Hawking

Time travel is something that has been popular among commoners, admired by kids and sought after by scientists. Franchises going from "Doctor Who" to "Star Trek" to "Back to the Future" have seen people get in a vehicle and show up previously or future, prepared to take on new experiences. Each accompany their own time travel hypotheses.

The truth, notwithstanding, is more tangled. Not all researchers accept that time travel is conceivable. Some even say that an endeavor would be lethal to any human who decides to attempt it.

## Understanding Time:

What is time? While a great many people consider time as consistent, physicist Albert Einstein demonstrated that time is a dream, more sort of an illusion; it is relative —it can fluctuate for various onlookers relying upon your speed through space. To Einstein, time is the "fourth dimension." Space is depicted as a three-dimensional field, which gives a voyager coordinates —for example, length, width and height —indicating location. Time provides another coordinate —direction —although conventionally, it only moves ahead. (Then again, another hypothesis declares that time is "real.")
Time dilation is a difference in the elapsed time as measured by two clocks due to either a relative velocity or a difference in gravitational potential
between their locations. Also, under Einstein's theory of general relativity, gravity can bend time. ... When anything that has mass sits on that piece of fabric, it causes a dimple or a bending of space-time. The bendingof space-time causes objects to move on a curved path and that curvature of space is what we know as graity.

### Time travel theories: Through a Wormhole

General relativity also provides scenarios that could allow travelers to go back in time. The equations, however, might be difficult to physically achieve.

One chance could be to go quicker than light, which goes at 186,282 miles for every second (299,792 kilometers for each second) in a vacuum. Einstein's conditions, however, show that an item at the speed of light would have both unending mass and a length of 0. This gives off an impression of being genuinely outlandish, albeit a few researchers have broadened his conditions and said it might be achieved.

A connected chance, NASA expressed, is to create "wormholes" between points in space-time. While Einstein's conditions accommodate them, they would crumple rapidly and would just be reasonable for little particles. Additionally, researchers haven't really observed these wormholes yet. Additionally, the innovation and technology expected to make a wormhole is a long way past anything we have today.

### Time travel theories: Infinite cylinder

Astronomer Frank Tipler proposed a system (in some cases known as a Tipler Cylinder) where one would take matter that is multiple times the sun's mass, around 10 times, then roll it into very long but very dense cylinder.

Subsequent to turning this up a couple billion cycles for every moment, a spaceship close by —following an extremely precise spiral around this chamber —could get itself on a "shut, time-like bend", as indicated by the Anderson Institute. There are restrictions with this technique, nonetheless, including the way that the chamber should be endlessly long for this to work.

### Time travel theories: Black Holes

Mysterious black holes could be the key to time travelbecause the phenomena have the ability to dilate time.When the spaceship reaches light speed, time is separately relative to both the clock on Earth and in the spaceship. As the speed of light is constant for both parties, it would seem as if time would be moving much slower on the rocket.Hypothetically, as one gets closer to the black hole, time would appear to be travelling normally but for observers on the outside, thousands of years would have passed.Billions of years will pass as you dive inside of a black hole. Slowly and slowly you would see the whole universe in just one circle.However, there are a few issues with this theory.Firstly, there is no chance that one would survive falling into a black hole, so time travelling would be futile. This is due to a process called “spaghettification”. The immense gravitational pull is so strong that the force is much stronger at the base than the top.Another impossible hurdle to overcome would be getting to a black hole.The nearest black hole to our planet is located 6,523 light-years away –one light-year is 5.88 trillion miles.The farthest humans have been from Earth is 248,655 miles (400,171 km) in 1970 as part of NASA’s Apollo 13 mission when the craft swung around the far side of the moon –it took almost three days to get there.

### Time travel theories: Cosmic Strings

Another hypothesis for potential time travelers includes something many refer to as cosmic strings —restricted containers of energy extended over the whole length of the ever-growing universe. These thin regions,left over from the early universe, are anticipated to contain enormous measures of mass and in this way could twist the space-time around them.

Inestimable strings are either vast or they're in circles, without any closures, researchers state. The methodology of two such strings parallel to one another would twist space-time so overwhelmingly and in such a specific setup that may make time travel conceivable, in principle.

## So, is time travel possible?

While time travel does not appear possible —at least, possible in the sense that the humans would survive it —with the physics that we use today, the field is constantly changing. Advances in quantum theories could perhaps provide some understanding of how to overcome time travel paradoxes.One possibility, although it would not necessarily lead to time travel, is solving the mystery of how certain particles can communicate instantly with each other, faster than the speed of light.In the meantime, however, interested time travelers can at least experience it vicariously through movies, television and books.Whether humans achieve the power to travel through time or not, but one thing is for sure, the research on time will surely take us into an unexpected future.
